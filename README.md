Preprocess the data:
Clean the text data by removing unnecessary characters, symbols, and stopwords.
Tokenize the text data to convert them into numerical inputs for the model.
Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
Fine-tune BERT model:
Choose the BERT Base Uncased option
Load the pre-trained BERT model and add a classification layer on top of it.
Train the model on the training set using a suitable loss function and optimizer.
Evaluate the model performance on the validation set and fine-tune the hyperparameters accordingly.
Test the model on the test set to evaluate its generalization performance.
Extract keywords using keyBERT:
Load the fine-tuned BERT model and use it to encode the text data into embeddings.
Initialize the keyBERT model with the embeddings and the corresponding keywords.
Extract the top-k keywords for each text data using the keyBERT model.

Regarding the BERT option to choose, BERT Base Uncased is a good option if you have limited computational resources as it has fewer parameters.

BERT (Details):

Input data preprocessing:
Tokenization: The input text is split into individual words or subwords (based on BERT's subword tokenization method) and mapped to their corresponding index values in BERT's vocabulary.
Padding: The input sequences are padded to a fixed length to ensure that all sequences have the same length for batch processing.
Extra: Masking: Some input tokens are masked (i.e., replaced with the [MASK] token) to improve the model's ability to predict masked tokens during training. 
Fine-tuning process:
Loading the pre-trained BERT model
Adding a classification layer
Optimization: Adam?
Loss function: BCEWithLogitsLoss.
Extra: Gradient clipping: To avoid exploding gradients during training, gradient clipping can be applied to ensure that the gradients remain within a certain range.
Early stopping: To prevent overfitting, early stopping can be applied, which stops the training process once the validation loss stops improving.
Extra: Learning rate scheduling: To improve training efficiency, the learning rate can be scheduled to decrease over time or based on the validation loss.
Evaluation:
Validation set evaluation and adjustment of the hyperparameters if necessary.
Test set evaluation
Post-processing:
Inference: The fine-tuned BERT model can be used to make predictions on new input text data.
